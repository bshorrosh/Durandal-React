This sample uses Reactjs with Durandaljs and is based on the following:

- An intro to the React Framework:<br/>
https://github.com/NETTUTS/react-intro

- Durandal Html starter kit:<br/>
http://durandaljs.com/get-started.html

- A require.js plugin that allows you to use JSX files as require.js dependencies:<br/>
https://github.com/seiffert/require-jsx


Hope it's useful to someone.
